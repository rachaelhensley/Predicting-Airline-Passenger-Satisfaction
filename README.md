Overview:
Our team analyzed survey data to predict airline passenger satisfaction with the goal of retaining satisfied customers to bolster brand loyalty. From a business perspective, it is more cost-effective to keep current customers satisfied rather than to acquire new ones. 

Data Description: 
We sourced our airline satisfaction dataset via Kaggle. The dataset contains 103,904 instances, each with 22 potential satisfaction predictors.

Methodology: 
Import and Preprocessing Data: Load data into Orange, removed unnecessary features, transformed dummy variables, and normalized variables.
Modeling: Produced 7 different models on training set to determine best overall model based on accuracy on train and test data.
Profit Analysis: Using best overall model, to predict optimal profit for airline promotion.
Clustering: Gathered additional insights on patterns and groupings of passengers through clustering techniques.
Recommendation: Offered recommendations of how to build brand loyalty through brand loyalty based on our models, profit analysis, and clustering.

Report: Compile a report detailing the methodology, findings, visualizations, and recommendations.

Expected Outcome: The expected outcome of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive report that offers clear insights into passenger airline satisfaction and how to continue making them satisfied through predictive modeling.
